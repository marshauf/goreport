========

A report library for go.
Instead of logging everything and generating endless log files, goreport forms logs into reports.
At any point in a process the report can be exported.

# Features
+ Log collecting into reports
+ Middleware via filters (formatting, filtering, ....)
+ Multiple outputs
+ Output control, only output if report contains an error (reduces log size and only logs things which are important)

# ⚠ - Warning
